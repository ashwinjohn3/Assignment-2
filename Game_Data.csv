4,Minecraft,Misc,PC,Mojang,10.0,2010.0,4.34,"One of the most popular games of the 2010s, Minecraft allows you to rebuild the environment around you. The world of the game is open, infinitely wide, and procedurally generated. It is composed of small 3D cubes that represent specific types of materials or terrain. The gameplay is centered on mining and building various structures of your choice. You can also craft items like tools, weapons, and armor. There&#39;s an option to shift to the first or the third person view.<br />
Minecraft includes multiple modes that dramatically change the focus of the game. Survival and Adventure modes require the player to gather resources, hunt for food and fight monsters to survive. In the Hardcore mode, there’s even permanent death. Creative mode, by contrast, offers you to freely explore the world and construct whatever you want with unlimited resources. There’s also a multiplayer mode that allows the players to share their worlds and engage in the traditional MMO activities, such as player-vs-player combat.<br />
Minecraft’s crude visual style, reminiscent of Lego cubes, became an iconic part of the popular culture. There are many myths and fan fiction surrounding the game, such as the legend of Herobrine, a rumored character that officially doesn’t exist."

The game belongs to the category of open world projects. It means that the world can be explored by the player in a free manner there. All the game space is a simplified model of the Holy Land. The area is divided into seven main sections. 
The player will have to climb on a lot of different buildings and towers. The architecture of the cities in Assassin&#39;s Creed is specially designed so that Altair can jump on any roof. Throughout the game, these skills will not just be used to perform additional tasks.
An essential part of the game is the investigation and the associated need to merge with the crowd. Each time, getting to the big city, Altair has to look around properly and find the office of assassins. The head of the Bureau will tell him about his future victim and will bring to some people who have useful information."

The fighting system is very flexible. Choosing from three different styles, you can adapt Geralt for any kind of a combat situation.

The strong style focuses itself on destroying your enemies with powerful attacks, while sweeping style is very good when facing a number of foes.

Wuhu Island has so many things to do, there&#39;s never a dull moment. A dozen activities await visitors: Archery, Frisbee®, Basketball, Cycling, Canoeing, Power Cruising, Table Tennis, Air Sports, Bowling, Swordplay, Golf and Wakeboarding.
The activities use the precision controls of the Wii MotionPlus accessory to help players come much closer to the physical reality of engaging in the actual sports. Every real-world action, whether it&#39;s a perfect drive on the fairway or a slice off the course, is meant to be faithfully replicated.
Each activity has multiple fun challenges designed to keep visitors coming back for more. Basketball players might compete in a three-point shootout or jump into a three-on-three pickup game. Archery enthusiasts must aim for the bull&#39;s-eye across ever-increasing distances and obstacles.
Different activities use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers in different ways. For example, players hold the Wii Remote like a paddle in Canoeing, while in Cycling they use both arms to “pedal” with the two controllers. The Wii MotionPlus accessory picks up every nuance of motion and translates it onto the TV screen.
Depending on the activity, players can compete solo or against other players. Some activities even let players team up to work cooperatively."

<h3>Plot</h3>
In 2003, the United States government formed a new covert agency to gather intelligence. It is a top-secret organization named Third Echelon. The agency has access to cutting-edge surveillance and military technologies. Third Echelon&#39;s agents are free to violate any law as long as it is required to complete the mission successfully.
In 2004, contact is lost with a CIA agent. Homeland security sends a second agent to check on the CIA&#39;s asset, yet contact is lost again. Third Echelon sends Sam Fischer to investigate the situation.
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
The game&#39;s main focus is to hide from the enemy instead of going loud and gun-blazing. The players have to leave no trace of themselves. It is essential to stick to the shadows, use the environment for cover and carefully pick your equipment to avoid detection.
Shadows are the best friend of the player. A special indicator is present on an in-game HUD that shows if the players are visible to their enemies. The game does not welcome the usage of weapons as the sound of gunfire is very loud and can be heard from the distance. The players have to rely on headshots, as they don&#39;t have much ammo on them. Sam has multiple advanced gadgets to aid him in his mission as well as a lot of hand-to-hand combat experience."

Their famous protagonists fight each other on an arena. In accordance with its name, the game is the “ultimate” installment of the series, in that it offers the players all the characters ever featured in Super Smash Bros. The game also introduces five new characters, most famously, Castlevania&#39;s Simon Belmont.
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
Unlike most fighting games, Super Smash Bros. series is built around knocking opponents out of the arena rather than lowering their health bars. However, the damage meter increases the character&#39;s chances to be knocked out. Each fighter has a limited number of lives and loses one when he or she is knocked out. The player is eliminated when he or she loses all lives.
<h3>Multiplayer</h3>
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate includes several competitive multiplayer modes. Besides the traditional versus mode, there are several new modes not featured in the previous games. These include Tournament (the playoff mode for 32 players), Smash Squad (team multiplayer), Smashdown (a mode in which the defeated characters are eliminated)."

Our goal as a player is to ensure that Vercetti becomes the boss of all of Vice City’s mafia, and various story characters will help us or prevent us from achieving this goal.

The objective of the game is to win all the provided races, championships, complete license tests and achieve 100% game completion. Every 25% of the game completed results in the player being awarded a car as a special prize. For GT3, the Gran Turismo Mode (Simulation Mode in the North American version) has a reorganized layout, with a more structured and progressive arrangement of races and challenges. Races vary from short beginner events to multi-hour endurance races and also rallying events against an opponent. In addition, the car shops are now organized by country and then by manufacturer, which some find to be more intuitive than the East/West City method used in its predecessor.
The Arcade Mode is reorganized in &quot;stages&quot;; these stages are made up of 5 or 6 tracks pooled from all available tracks in the game, including both road and rally races. To get to the next stage, all tracks on a stage must be completed on Easy difficulty or higher. By beating the stage on Normal or Difficult, additional cars are unlocked as well for play in any mode of Arcade Mode (including two-player battle and time trial).
GT3 features 19 race courses, 14 of which have reverse variants&#39; and 4 of which are dirt tracks. Most of these circuits are at fictional locations, but California&#39;s Laguna Seca Raceway and Côte d’Azur (which is heavily based on the Monaco Grand Prix circuit) are not.
Other changes include the omission of the ability to &quot;race modify&quot; or add downforce to production cars, removal of suspension damage, and the absence of torque limits for races.
New to the franchise, GT3 also contained unlicensed versions of six actual Formula One cars, labelled as F686/M, F687/S, F688/S, F090/S, F094/H and F094/S (in the Japanese and American versions) that the player could win from endurance races. In the Japanese and American versions, the name of each car denotes various pieces of information (such as the amount of cylinders in the engine, the year the chassis was raced, and its driver, respectively). For example, the a forementioned F094/S was the 10-cylinder, 1994-season car driven by Ayrton Senna, whereas the F686/M represented the 6-cylinder, 1986-season car driven by Nigel Mansell. In the PAL release, however, there were only two F1 cars, not obviously based on any real-life counterparts and instead labelled as Polyphony 001 and 002 respectively.
GT3 also marks informal appearances of automakers Lamborghini and Porsche. A racing JGTC Lamborghini Diablo was featured in the NTSC-J version (where the car has been cut from NTSC-U copy and being available in NTSC-U copy with a cheat device), and a Porsche 911 GT3 can be found in the game code (though it cannot be obtained normally, and requires the use of a cheat device). Both cars, together with two hidden Lancia Stratoses (road and rally versions), however, are completely absent in PAL version. Lamborghini would make its first official appearance in 2009&#39;s Gran Turismo (PSP), while Porsche made its first official appearance in Gran Turismo Sport for the PlayStation 4."

97,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Fighting,Wii,Nintendo,9.2,2008.0,4.29,"Super Smash Bros. Brawl is a crossover platform fighting game for the Nintendo Wii published by Nintendo in 2008 and the third entry in the Super Smash Bros. series. It was developed by an ad hoc development team consisting of staff from Sora Ltd, GAME ARTS, Monolith Soft, HAL Laboratory and Paon.
Like the two precedent instalments, the game features characters, locations and items from various Nintendo video game franchises such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda or Kirby. However, Brawl is the first game to include characters from third-party franchises, such as Sonic the Hedgehog or Solid Snake from the Metal Gear series. 
The Smash Bros. series is notable among fighting games for its unorthodox gameplay. A game takes place on a stage that could be compared to a platform game level. Instead of a health bar, damage is represented by a percentage. When a player hits another, the victim&#39;s percentage increases. The higher the percentage, the further a player will be knocked away when hit. The goal is to knock other players out of the screen using a varied set of moves. Two to four players can fight at the same time, either in a free-for-all match or a team battle. Special rulesets also allow for different win conditions.
Items randomly appear around the stage and can be picked up and used by fighters to aid in combat. These include food that heals the user, various weapons such as laser swords or firework launchers, or even Pokéballs containing powerful Pokémon. Brawl also introduces Assist Trophies, items that allow one to summon characters from various franchises to fight for them temporarily, as well as Smash Balls, which, when broken, allow a fighter to unleash their ultimate attack on their opponents. The game also supports custom rulesets, allowing players to disable items if they wish.
Brawl is the first game in the series to include a complete single-player story campaign, named the Subspace Emissary. It features all the playable characters in the midst of a conflict against a mysterious entity looking to collect pieces of their world for an unknown reason. The player fights hoards of enemies throughout a multitude of platforming levels. It was also the first game to allow online play with friends or random players. This feature is no longer available due to the discontinuation of the Wii&#39;s online service in May 2014
Super Smash Bros. Brawl was praised by the critic for its fun and easy to learn gameplay, its sheer density and the attention put into the representation of its featured franchises. However, it left many fans of the series, particularly its competitive aspect, disappointed. The changes made to the gameplay from Melee considerably slowed the pace of the game and severe balance issues existed, which resulted in the game&#39;s competitive scene becoming inactive early in its life. To fix these issues, players resorted to modding. Among the various mods that were created was Project M, a mod that, at first, aimed to make Brawl feel more like its predecessor Melee, and later grew to become much more distinct from any game in the series. Project M gathered a decently sized competitive scene to the point where it was played at major tournaments along with the official games, but its development eventually shut down in 2015.
Despite this, Brawl is the eight best-selling game on the Wii, having sold 13.29 million units as of March 2018. It is often considered to be the best Smash Bros. game for casual play or single-player."
98,Marvel's Spider-Man,Action-Adventure,PS4,Sony Interactive Entertainment,9.1,2018.0,4.43,"Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man offers the player to take on the role of the most famous Marvel superhero.
<h3>Plot</h3>
The game introduces Spider-Man as an already experienced superhero. By the time the game begins, Peter has captured the infamous Kingpin as well as several other supervillains. Now, a gang that goes by the name of Demons poses a new danger to New York. Meanwhile, Peter is working for the scientist Otto Octavius, who didn&#39;t yet become Dr. Octopus, on their science project. Throughout the game, Spidey has to deal with multiple enemies, such as Norman Osbourne, Electro, Vulture, Rhino and Kingpin, among others.
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
The player controls Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man, from the third person view. There are also sections of the game in which the player controls other protagonists, namely Mary Jane and Miles Morales. The game is set in a 3D environment that is modeled after New York City. The player can travel the city using web slings, running, jumping, and crawling the walls. The setting includes numerous high-rise buildings designed specifically for Spider-Man&#39;s movements.
As the player progresses, he or she unlocks new suits that grant Spider-Man new abilities, such as additional attacks or enhanced Spider-Sense. The abilities are not tied to the suits, however, and the player can use the suit of his or her choice without losing the ability. The combat system is similar to that in Batman: Arkham, in that Spider-Man fights many opponents in hand-to-hand combat but avoids killing them."
99,Grand Theft Auto III,Action,PS2,Rockstar Games,9.5,2001.0,4.18,"Grand Theft Auto III is an open-world action game, a part of the criminal franchise GTA. As the first in the series 3D game with high-quality textures, GTA III became exemplary in its genre. 
The action is located in fictional Liberty City. Its map is divided into three parts – each becomes available gradually, depending on the storyline progress. The player takes control of the character from the third-person view. 
The classic feature of GTA III is the ability to interact with the world: explore the map either on foot or by car, contact with other characters, visit weapon stores and shoot everywhere. Although GTA III is another chapter of the franchise, its plot is unique. 
The story begins with the dynamic bank robbery. During the heist scene, the main character (silent and unnamed for the whole game) gets betrayed by his accomplice Catalina. By good fortune, the protagonist escapes from imprisonment and starts making both ends meet in Liberty City after being deceived. Therefore, his only wish – also the main idea of the storyline – to take the revenge on the former partner."
100,Portal 2,Shooter,PC,Valve,9.7,2011.0,4.61,"Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle game developed by Valve Corporation and released on April 19, 2011 on Steam, PS3 and Xbox 360. It was published by Valve Corporation in digital form and by Electronic Arts in physical form. 
Its plot directly follows the first game&#39;s, taking place in the Half-Life universe. You play as Chell, a test subject in a research facility formerly ran by the company Aperture Science, but taken over by an evil AI that turned upon its creators, GladOS. After defeating GladOS at the end of the first game but failing to escape the facility, Chell is woken up from a stasis chamber by an AI personality core, Wheatley, as the unkempt complex is falling apart. As the two attempt to navigate through the ruins and escape, they stumble upon GladOS, and accidentally re-activate her...
Portal 2&#39;s core mechanics are very similar to the first game&#39;s ; the player must make their way through several test chambers which involve puzzles. For this purpose, they possess a Portal Gun, a weapon capable of creating teleportation portals on white surfaces. This seemingly simple mechanic and its subtleties coupled with the many different puzzle elements that can appear in puzzles allows the game to be easy to start playing, yet still feature profound gameplay. The sequel adds several new puzzle elements, such as gel that can render surfaces bouncy or allow you to accelerate when running on them.
The game is often praised for its gameplay, its memorable dialogue and writing and its aesthetic. Both games in the series are responsible for inspiring most puzzle games succeeding them, particularly first-person puzzle games. The series, its characters and even its items such as the portal gun and the companion cube have become a cultural icon within gaming communities.
Portal 2 also features a co-op mode where two players take on the roles of robots being led through tests by GladOS, as well as an in-depth level editor."

The hero has many different activities: plant and care for plants, raise livestock, practice crafts, extract ore, and also enter into relationships with residents of the neighbouring town to earn game money. Relationships with characters include communication, performing tasks for money, exchanging, searching for fossils and even military actions and marrying.

Like most other Final Fantasy entries, the game takes place in an entirely new world that is not connected with previous games in the series. It can be described as the mix of modern Europe and futuristic setting with high fantasy influences. The game follows six main heroes, five of which are members of the elite military organization called SeeD, on their quest to defeat Ultimecia, an evil sorceress who wishes to compress time. Like its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII, the game heavily focuses on its story, characters and game world exposure.  
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
The gameplay of Final Fantasy VIII shares many similarities with other JRPGs of that era. The player can explore the overworld, visit different locations such as town, settlements, forests, interact with NPCs and fight numerous types of monsters in turn-based battles.<br />
While the world exploration aspect, for the most part, is similar to that of the previous game, the battle system has several notable differences. The combat in the game is centered on Junction system that allows the player to junction summoned monsters known as Guardian Forces to platy members.

The disease causes irreversible changes in the human body, a person loses his mind and behaves aggressively, like a zombie. Civilization no longer exists, few survivors live in isolation under the protection of the military.<br />
Cities outside the zones are dangerous ruins inhabited by infected people and people who have almost lost humanity.<br />
Heroes, the smuggler Joel and teenage girl Ellie, are trying to cross the continent, colliding in depopulated cities with all the set of dangers.

The levels of the game are very extensive, at each level the task is the same - to reach a certain point alive.
Characters have something like a shotgun pistol, bow and arrow, as well as improvised items - pipes, sticks, baseball bats.<br />

179,GoldenEye 007,Shooter,N64,Nintendo,9.8,1997.0,4.34,"GoldenEye 007 is a first-person shooter video game developed by Rare and based on the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye. It was released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in August 1997. The game features a single-player campaign in which players assume the role of British Secret Intelligence Service agent James Bond as he fights to prevent a criminal syndicate from using a satellite weapon against London to cause a global financial meltdown. The game includes a split-screen multiplayer mode in which two, three, or four players can compete in different types of deathmatch games.<br />
GoldenEye 007 was developed over a period of two and a half years by an inexperienced team led by Martin Hollis, who had previously worked on the coin-op version of Killer Instinct. It was partially conceived as an on-rails shooter inspired by Sega&#39;s Virtua Cop, before being redesigned as a free-roaming shooter. The game was highly acclaimed by the gaming media and sold over eight million copies worldwide, making it the third-best-selling Nintendo 64 game. It received the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Games Award and four awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences.<br />
Retrospectively, GoldenEye 007 is considered an important game in the history of first-person shooters for demonstrating the viability of game consoles as platforms for the genre, and for signalling a transition from the then-standard Doom-like approach to a more realistic style. It pioneered features such as atmospheric single-player missions, stealth elements, and a console multiplayer deathmatch mode. The game is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. A spiritual successor, Perfect Dark, was released in 2000, while a reimagining of the game, also titled GoldenEye 007, was released in 2010."

There are also settings that define if the sims will age, and how fast.
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
The game introduces the open world that lives on its own even when the player doesn&#39;t interfere. Unlike in Sims 2, the world is seamless and there&#39;s no long load time when you travel it. The sims themselves became more independent and require less player attention to stay alive. Sims 3 is less oriented towards &quot;tamagotchi&quot;-like life-sustaining and more towards actually living the sims&#39; lives, such as going to work, attending parties, making friends and flirting. The sims will occasionally have wishes, and fulfilling them earns the character more happiness points.
<h3>Building homes</h3>
The building mode didn&#39;t change much since Sims 2, but the game introduced a few additional options. Most notably, elements don&#39;t have to be aligned to a grid anymore. The player can place them diagonally at any angle."
